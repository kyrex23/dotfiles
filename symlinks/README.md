<h1 align="center">üî• AUTOGENERATED SYMLINKS (DOTBOT) üî•</h1>

This repository will contain a lot of configuration files to streamline the process of setting up a new Linux installation.

To avoid having to manage two versions of each file (the one used by the system and the one in this repository), it is best to create a symbolic link so that the system uses the files inside the repository.

However, this can still be tedious if done manually, so we can use [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to automate this process.

# üå± Getting Started

`dotbot` is included as a submodule (located at `modules/dotbot`) following its own instructions:

```bash
# go to your own dotfiles repository
cd <path_to_repository>
# add dotbot as a submodule and store it in modules/ directory
git submodule add https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot modules/dotbot
# ignore dirty commits in the submodule
git config -f .gitmodules submodule.modules/dotbot.ignore dirty
# copy the installation script to a more convenient location
cp modules/dotbot/tools/git-submodule/install symlinks
# alternatively to the previous step, you can create a symlink of the `install` file instead of copy it
# ln -s modules/dotbot/tools/git-submodule/install --target symlinks
# create your own configuration file for dotbot
touch symlinks/install.conf.yaml
```

# ‚ùì How to use it

The folder `symlinks` contains the necessary files to use `dotbot`:
```
symlinks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ install             # script to run dotbot
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ install.conf.yaml   # your own configuration file for dotbot
```

To run all the directives defined in your `install.conf.yaml` configuration file, use the following command:

```bash
symlinks/install
```

If you only want to run a specific directive (for example: `link`), use the following command instead:

```bash
symlinks/install --only link
```

And if you want to run all the directives except one (for example: `shell`), use:

```bash
symlinks/install --except shell
```
